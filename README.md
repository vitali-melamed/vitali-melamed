# Hi there

I am relatively new in the field of web development. I started learning the fundamentals of web in early 2019. I have undertaken Certificate IV and Diploma in web development studies. I am learning new skills everyday on Udemy such as front end frameworks like React. I mainly work with the front end. I do have some exposure to the back end. I like to program in JavaScript and PHP as my go to programming languages.
