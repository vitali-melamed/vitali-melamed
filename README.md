I am an enthusiastic front-end web developer with a solid foundation in front-end web development and growing experience in front-end practices. Since beginning my web development journey in 2019, I have completed a Certificate IV and Diploma in Web Development, and I continue to expand my skill set through self-directed learning on platforms such as Udemy. My strengths lie in creating responsive and user-friendly front-end websites using modern frameworks like React, while I also have exposure to some back-end web development. I enjoy coding primarily in JavaScript and PHP and I am passionate about continuously developing my technical skills to deliver high-quality web projects.
